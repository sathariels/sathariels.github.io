- name: Space Knights Items Shop
  descr: "Space Knights is an upcoming Roblox game launching in late 2025, and I had the opportunity to develop the in-game item shop where players can purchase weapons of varying rarities. Using Roblox Studio, I designed the shop's user interface and experience, uploaded hundreds of animations, and implemented key features using Lua—including a search function powered by the Levenshtein distance algorithm to improve usability. This project was a major milestone in my development journey, allowing me to apply computer science concepts, collaborate with experienced mentors, receive and incorporate feedback, and bring creative solutions to real-world game design challenges. Check out my blog for more insights and visuals from the project."

- name: One Suryan Website Creation
  descr: "As the Executive Director of Management for One Suryan, a student-led organization focused on empowering the global South Asian community, I led strategic operations and oversaw a diverse, creative team. One of my key contributions was designing and developing the organization’s website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. I built a dynamic, responsive platform that highlights our mission, showcases articles in a structured grid layout, explains our purpose through a “What We Do” section, integrates social media links, and uses PHP loops to dynamically count published content. This project allowed me to blend technical skills with meaningful impact, creating a platform to inform and inspire others."

- name: 2D Game Engine
  descr: A custom-built 2D game engine written in C++, designed from the ground up to handle core gameplay systems such as rendering, input handling, entity management, and real-time collision detection. This project emphasizes performance, modularity, and low-level systems architecture, incorporating features like custom memory management and a lightweight game loop. Developed as a learning and portfolio piece to deepen my understanding of game engine architecture and C++ systems programming. COMING SOON!!
